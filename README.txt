This is the ApPredict - Action Potential Prediction - Chaste project

Before using this code you will need to download and install Chaste's
dependencies and the Chaste source code itself.

Please see 
https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/GettingStarted
for details of how to do this 
(follow instructions for "Development Code User").

This project is an extension of Chaste that is intended to be used 
for simulation of drug action in cardiac electrophysiology models. 

It must be checked out into
<chaste source directory>/projects/ApPredict
in order for file paths to be picked up correctly, and 
it should be used with the current revision of Chaste.

(replacing <chaste source directory> with the place you have put the 
Chaste source code).

So the following instructions should work:
cd <chaste source directory>/projects
svn co https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/projects/ApPredict
